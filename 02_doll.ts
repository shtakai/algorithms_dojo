//You and a friend were super bored and wanted to make a Russian Doll emulator:
//When someone click's the button next to the doll saying value: the doll spins
//around and shows a value. When someone click's on the doll itself.
//It opens up and if there is another doll inside, that doll will show up,
//otherwise a flag pops up saying: no more dolls! As doll administrators,
//you want to be able to add a new doll to the outer shell...
//Implement the back end code for your Russian Doll emulator.
//(feel free to implement it into a webpage if you want!)

var RussianDoll = function () {

}
